Our key questions are:
1. Are we seeing any lead quality trends over time (improving, declining)? Are they statistically
significant?
2. What can we learn about the drivers of "lead quality" from this dataset? What segments -
where the ad was shown, what kind of person filled out the ad, what kind of ad did they see -
have differing lead quality rates?
3. If the advertiser says they will increase our CPL by 20% (i.e., $30 to $33) if we increase our
lead quality by 20% (i.e., from 8.0% to 9.6%), do we see any opportunities to do that here?
What kinds of things could we do?
